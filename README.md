# Nutrition Label - HTML&CSS ![Project Views](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/api/count/incr/badge.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FBrunosCodeLab%2FNutritionLabel-HTML_CSS&count_bg=%235C9CFF&title_bg=%23008FC9&icon=&icon_color=%23E7E7E7&title=hits&edge_flat=false)


During my visit to the US, I noticed how nutrition labels differed from those in Europe. I particularly appreciated the clarity of the US labels, with their larger font size for calorie counts and overall transparency in design. 
Inspired by this, I decided to practice my HTML and CSS skills by recreating a US-style nutrition label.
